### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Ã‚ngelo, I'm 19 years old and I'm a software developer.

Graduated from technical education in computer technician by SATC in the year 2020, I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in software engineering, also by SATC.

I'm a full-stack developer, currently working with .net and javascript and studying other languages and frameworks, such as typescript, react, angular, python, among others.
